My personal website created with vuepress. It is easy arrange and deploy thanks to markdown page creation system.

Run in your local by below script for development purposes.
```sh
npm run dev
```

Create a production build.
```sh
npm run build
```

I set up a CI/CD pipeline in DigitalOcean using Apps to directly redeploy if there is a change in the main branch.
