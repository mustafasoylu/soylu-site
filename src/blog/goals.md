# Achieving My Goals

I have been trying to do so many things at once that I realize I am not doing them correctly. Therefore, I decided to work on my productivity skills and manage my time more efficiently. I have been aware of [skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/) for a time, and I decided it was time to go there, increase my productivity, and learn drawing.

I started a learning path called [Productivity For Creatives: Make More of Your Time](https://www.skillshare.com/paths/Productivity-For-Creatives-Make-More-of-Your-Time/2785595) to learn how to set my goals and improve my workflow, which I don't have. Currently, I finished the first lesson and set my goals and current focuses as below. I strongly suggest everyone with similar problems check this learning path out.

## Current Focus

In order to achieve my goals, I learned that I have to choose several and focus on them. All the other goals become a "not-to-do list" for me. I have already experienced that trying to do everything simultaneously does not work. Thus, I have a maximum of 4 goals I focus on at a time.

- Set up habits and workflows
- 4 days gym schedule for 2 months
- PLMS Project
- Find a source for learning drawing basics

## My Impossible List

I classified the things I want to achieve with little help from [this page](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) of the first lecturer in the learning path mentioned above.
